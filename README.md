# dotnet-core-kata-boilerplate

PLEASE NOTE THIS PROJECT IS DEPRECATED AND IS RUNNING AN OLD VERSION OF DOTNET CORE. IT IS ADVISED TO SIMPLY USE THE DOTNET CLI TO GENERATE A NEW MSTEST PROJECT AND CLASS LIBRARY.

Simple boilerplate to get up and going on a kata faster. Doing the configuration every time is tedious.

Provided classes are purely meant as example code, not as a reference for final project structure. Files
should be well named and well structured, with the Test project structure mirroring that of the Lib project. 

## Usage
To get all dependencies in the project built...
~~~~
git clone
./setup.sh
